# Adguard Scripts Collection

This repository contains a personal collection of configuration files and scripts for AdGuard and similar network-filtering tools. It includes:

- **conf/** – rewrite and proxy configuration files for various services (e.g. Cake, PlaneVPN, Quantumult X).
- **js/** – JavaScript snippets used to block ads or unlock premium features in different apps.
- **list/** – custom blocklists and allowlists such as `ban.list` and `wechat.list`.
- **module/** – modular rule sets for apps like Calm, Lingvist, and TickTick.
- **files/** and **icon/** – supporting assets (data files and icons) referenced by the configurations.

These resources are intended for personal experimentation. Use them at your own risk.
